## Logs of viewing each screen and some operations

"Tokyo Station Around" logs the count of each screen in the application is viewed, the order in which visitors go around, and the history of some screen operations.
These logs will be sent to an external server (Firebase, etc.) in a form that does not allow individuals to be identified, and will be used to improve the service.
However, if you do not agree to send logs, you can disable it from the settings screen.
